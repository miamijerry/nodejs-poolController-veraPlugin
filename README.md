## What is nodejs-poolController-veraPlugin
This is a plugin that interacts with an installed nodejs-poolController server to provide automation and control for your Vera home automation hub.  The nodejs-poolController server allows you to control Pentair pool equipment via its RS485 port.  This includes outdoor control panels for IntelliCenter, IntelliTouch, and EasyTouch.  It also includes a standalone function that allows you to control pumps and chlorinators without an automation controller.
