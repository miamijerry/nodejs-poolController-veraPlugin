## What is nodejs-poolController-veraPlugin
This is a plugin that interacts with an installed nodejs-poolController server to provide automation and control for your Vera home automation hub.  The nodejs-poolController server allows you to control Pentair pool equipment via its RS485 port.  This includes outdoor control panels for IntelliCenter, IntelliTouch, and EasyTouch.  It also includes a standalone function that allows you to control pumps and chlorinators without an automation controller.

You can find [nodejs-poolController here](https://github.com/tagyoureit/nodejs-poolController/tree/next).

NOTE: This plugin does not work with version 5 or below.  You must install version 6.x and above.
